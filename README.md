The application offers users a convenient platform to analyze their spending patterns through interactive visualizations and accurate extraction of text data from invoice images.

**Key Features**:

**Image Text Extraction**: Implemented image processing algorithms to precisely extract text from invoice images uploaded by users, ensuring accurate data retrieval.

**Database Management**: Designed and implemented a robust database schema using MySQL and SQL Alchemy to efficiently store and manage extracted invoice data.

**Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations including pie charts, bar charts, and line charts using Plotly to display users' spending patterns in an intuitive manner.

**Google Cloud Vision API Integration**: Integrated the Google Cloud Vision API to enhance text extraction from invoice images, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data processing.

**Containerization with Docker**: Utilized Docker for containerization, enabling seamless deployment and scalability across various environments.

**Continuous Integration and Deploymen**t: Configured GitHub Actions to automate the building of Docker images and pushing them to Docker Hub upon code changes, ensuring a streamlined development process.

**Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Orchestrated the deployment of Docker images to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for production deployment, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting.

**User Interface Design**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly web interface for easy navigation and visualization of spending data, enhancing user experience.

**Data Security**: Ensured data security and confidentiality by securely handling sensitive information such as database credentials and user data.
